		SWIFT FOX README


The doc/ directory contains the documentation of the Swift Fox 
programming language. The latest version of each document is 
stored into the corresponding PDF file. The final report is at
report.pdf. To compile the tex files latex is required.

The src/ directory contains the source code of the Swift Fox
language. The subdirectory called examples/ contains samples
of the Swift Fox code which compiles correctly. The subdirectory
regression/ contains the Swift Fox test suit, and finally sf/
has the Swift Fox compiler source code.

INSTALLATION

The following tools are necessary to compile Swift Fox:
    1. lex (flex)
    2. yacc (bison)
    3. make
    4. gcc

Set the system environment variable $FENNEC_FOX_LIB
to point to the location of the Fennec Fox platform.
If you installed Fennec Fox, the environmental variable
is already set.

To compile the code goto src/sf and run 'make'
$ cd src/sf/ ; make

To install run 'make install'
$ sudo make install

This will install Swift Fox Compiler 'sfc' and
Fennec Fox 'fennec' in /usr/local/bin

In case you want to run the regression testing suite, move
to the regression/ directory and run run 'make'
$ cd regression/ ; make

After that you can run the complete test suite by executing
'make test', or by invoking 'test_lex', 'test_parse', 'text_sem'
for testing only the corresponding part
$ make test
